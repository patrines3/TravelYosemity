# travelyosemity

Web automation using Python and Selenium to find lodging at [Yosemite Valley Lodge](https://travelyosemite.com/) 

At this stage most of the inputs are hardcoded to satisfy the immediate need we have, and I have programmed a cronjob to execute the travel_lodge_avail.py file every x minutes and send me a text message if it finds availability. It is not generating the reservation or actually checking to see which rooms are open. 

Let me know if you want to participate in the development of the project to facilitate the search of lodging in the travelyosemite.com website.
